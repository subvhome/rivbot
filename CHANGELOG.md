# Changelog

## v2.6 (continued)
- Fixed Discord API error for searches with long titles (e.g., "Game of Thrones," "Naruto") by truncating dropdown labels to fit within 100 characters.
## v2.6
- Fixed IMDb ID retrieval for TV shows by using the "external_ids" endpoint from the TMDB API. This resolves the issue where TV shows couldn't be added due to missing IMDb IDs.
- Bot takes DM commands now
